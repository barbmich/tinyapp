# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
The project is available on [Heroku](https://barbmich-tinyapp.herokuapp.com/).

## Final Product

This is the first real project our cohort worked on, while learning the use of the dependencies packages.

It allows:
- Accounts creation with password hashing;
- A personal list of short URLS created through the form available;
- Editing and deletion of the short URLS submitted;

Note that once the server is taken down, all data registered will be lost.

The login page! If you don't have an account yet, there's a link to the registration form.

The list of short URLs created by you, available once logged in.

Each link has their own page where the short URL can be found, and a form to update their destination
