# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

- /urls, the main page. This is its look when not logged in.

- The login page! If you don't have an account yet, there's a link to the registration form.

- The list of short URLs created by you, available once logged in.

- Each link has their own page where the short URL can be found, and a form to update their destination
